# ReClip: Your External Brain for Digital Work

**Copy once. Organize instantly. Use everywhere.**

Stop breaking your flow to find that link you copied ten minutes ago. **ReClip** is the cross-platform clipboard manager designed for developers, designers, and power users who demand speed, privacy, and organization. It’s not just a history log; it’s a command center for your data.

### 🚀 Why ReClip?

Most clipboard managers are dumb buckets that hold text until it expires. ReClip is an active library. It recognizes what you copy—whether it’s a hex code, a JSON snippet, or a screenshot—and gives you the tools to use it instantly across macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android. With our **Smart Tagging System**, you can categorize snippets as you copy them, turning your clipboard into a searchable database that syncs everywhere.

### 🌟 Key Features

#### 🏷️ Smart Tagging & Organization
*   **Instant Tagging:** Add tags like `#work`, `#code`, or `#personal` to any clip instantly.
*   **Auto-Tagging Rules:** Set up rules to do the work for you.
    *   *Example:* Automatically tag any clip containing `function()` or `<div>` as `#code`.
    *   *Example:* Automatically tag any clip containing `@gmail.com` as `#email`.
*   **Snippet Library:** Pin your tagged clips to keep them permanently available at the top of your list.

#### 🧠 The Smart History (Contextual Awareness)
*   **Infinite Memory, Instant Recall:** Store unlimited clips. Use our **Neural Fuzzy Search** to find "that recipe" or "API key" even if you only remember a vague keyword from three weeks ago.
*   **Content Intelligence:** ReClip knows what you copied.
    *   *Colors:* Copy `#FF5733` and see a color preview. Convert it to RGB or HSL in one click.
    *   *Links:* Automatically strip tracking parameters (`utm_source`, `fbclid`) for clean sharing.
    *   *Code:* Auto-detect languages and offer syntax highlighting in the preview.
*   **On-Device OCR:** Copy text directly from images or screenshots within your history.

#### ⚡ The Productivity Flow (Speed)
*   **Paste Stacks (Sequential Pasting):** Need to copy a name, email, and phone number from a spreadsheet? Copy them all in a row, then paste them one by one (`Cmd+V` ... `Cmd+V` ...) without switching windows.
*   **Quick Actions & Scripts:** Transform text on the fly.
    *   *Format JSON/XML*
    *   *CamelCase ↔ snake_case*
    *   *Lowercase/Uppercase*

#### 🛡️ The Vault (Privacy & Security)
*   **Zero-Knowledge Sync:** Your clipboard syncs across devices using military-grade End-to-End Encryption (AES-256). We cannot see your data. Ever.
*   **Local P2P Mode:** Don't trust the cloud? Sync devices directly over your local WiFi network.
*   **Smart Masking:** ReClip automatically detects credit card numbers, passwords, and crypto wallet addresses, masking them in the UI and setting them to "Auto-Burn" (permanently delete) after 60 seconds.
*   **App Blacklisting:** Prevents recording when sensitive apps (like 1Password, Banking apps, or Incognito Mode) are in focus.

#### 🔗 The Bridge (Cross-Platform Ecosystem)
*   **Universal Clipboard:** Copy on your Mac, paste on your Android phone. Copy on Windows, paste on your iPad. It feels like magic.
*   **AirDrop for Text:** Send a specific clip to a nearby device instantly without cluttering your main history.

### � Roadmap: Building the Robust Future

We are constantly pushing the boundaries of what a clipboard manager can do. Here is a glimpse of what is coming in 2026:

*   **🔌 Scripting Engine:** Write custom JavaScript/Lua scripts to transform content on the fly (e.g., convert CSV rows to SQL `INSERT` statements).
*   **🧠 Local AI Integration:** Summarize articles, explain complex Regex, or translate text instantly using on-device LLMs.
*   **👥 Secure Team Sync:** Share encrypted snippets (API keys, config files) with your team directly, bypassing insecure chat logs.
*   **🏗️ IDE & App Integrations:** Direct plugins for VS Code, JetBrains, and Chrome to bridge your workflow gaps.
*   **⏮️ History Rewind:** A "Time Machine" view to visualize and recover your clipboard history from days or weeks ago.
